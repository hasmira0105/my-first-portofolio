          <h2 class="title">Exam Scores Dashboard based on student's characteristics</h2>
          <div class="col lg-12">
            <p>I designed a student dashboard using Excel tools like PivotTable, PivotChart, Slicers, and Macros.
              The dataset was originally pulled from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams"
              target="_blank">Kaggle</a>,
              consists of 1000 records with 5 student attributes (gender, ethnicity, parents' educational levels,
              lunch, and test preparation) and exam scores in 3 subjects: mathematics, reading, and writing.</p>
            <p>Assume that as a data analyst, we were requested to identify distinct patterns in average
              exam results based on student characteristics. In light of this, we constructed the dashboard
              shown below:</p>

        <p>Here's what we can discover of each chart: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the first chart (top-left), we grouped students by ethnicity and plotted
            the average result of 3 exams. We observe that students from group A have the
            highest average scores, whereas the students from group B have the lowest.
            If you wish to compare students' average scores of a particular ethnicity,
            use the slicer on the left side of the chart
          </li>

          <li>
            The second chart  (preparation course), shows that students who complete the preparation
            course have higher average scores.
          </li>

          <li>
            According to the parents' educational level chart, Students whose parents have finished a
            master's degree have the highest scores, whereas students whose parents have a
            high school education earn the lowest scores.
          </li>

          <li>
            Based on the Lunch chart, students who have the standard lunch are more likely to
            have a higher average exam results than students who have reduced/free lunch
          </li>

        </ol>
